# quick plot tdms 

Plot the data from a chosen tdms file. 
This module opens a tkinter window in which the file can be chosen, then the group and after choosing the channel, the data can be plotted. 
The user can also choose to plot the FFT of the data which opens a new canvas for this plot.
Right-clicking on one of the axes will convert that axis to a logarithmic plot.
